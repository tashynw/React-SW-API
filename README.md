VIDEO PREVIEW:

A front-end app was made with React.js and the SW-API ( https://swapi.dev/documentation#people ). This made use specifically of the people resources and contains alot of nested calls. To understand its complexity, refer to the video above and check out and test the API yourself with Postman/ThunderClient etc. The API periodically responds slow especially on weekends, so try to use it in the weekdays.
