A front-end app made with React.js and the SW-API ( https://swapi.dev/documentation#people ). This made use of the people resources of the API and contains alot of nested calls. To understand its complexity, refer to the video above and check out and test the API yourself with Postman/ThunderClient etc. The API sometimes responds slow especially on weekends, so try to use it in the weekdays.
